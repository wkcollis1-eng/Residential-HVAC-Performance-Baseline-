# Why This Home Is Not a Candidate for Standard Utility Programs

**Version:** 1.2.1  
**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Executive Summary

Most utility energy-efficiency programs are designed to capture large, low-cost savings across broad residential populations by targeting common deficiencies: leaky envelopes, oversized or aging equipment, and unmanaged loads. **This home does not fit that profile.**

With a measured site Energy Use Intensity (EUI) of 41.7 kBTU/ft²-yr—performing 33% better than the regional average and 15-25% better than typical ENERGY STAR homes in Climate Zone 5A—this property resides in a **performance regime beyond the design envelope of standard utility programs**.

This document quantifies why traditional utility interventions deliver limited value for high-performance homes and outlines alternative optimization pathways for this emerging residential efficiency class.

## Summary

In summary, this home resides in a performance regime beyond the design envelope of standard utility programs. Its remaining optimization opportunities are incremental, monitoring-driven, and operational, rather than prescriptive or equipment-based. As a result, utility program participation would likely deliver limited value and could obscure, rather than enhance, the already high level of measured performance documented in this baseline.
